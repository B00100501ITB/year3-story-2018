	<h1> Chapter 1 </h1>
	
	<p>In the near future, Detroit is on the verge of collapse due to unchecked crime.
	 Family man and honest cop ALEX MURPHY gets transferred to the worst precinct in town and finds a new partner in tough ANNE LEWIS.
	 On their first day together, they engage in a highway shootout with a gang of criminals. Murphy and Lewis trail the criminals to a steel mill,
	 but they become separated and Murphy is captured.
	 The criminals torture Murphy, and crime boss BODDICKER personally shoots him through the head.
	 Lewis is too late to help, and finds Murphy dead.

	 Meanwhile, Detroit mega-corporation O.C.P. enters into a contract with the city to run the police force,
	 effectively privatizing it. Recognizing that human law enforcers are insufficient to stop crime, OCP creates a cyborg “Robocop” program.
	 As Officer Murphy is the most recent cop to die, he “volunteers” to be the prototype,
	 and his body is joined with armor and artificial intelligence.
	 All this infuriates corrupt O.C.P. executive DICK JONES, whose own crime-stopping program was axed in favor of Robocop.
