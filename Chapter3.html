	<h1> Chapter 3</h1>
	<p>
	Lewis tends to RoboCop’s injuries and discovers that there is still some of Murphy’s old self present.
	Soon after, the police launch their long-threatened strike, sending Detroit into chaos. All criminals are released from jail
	— and that means Boddicker and his gang are free again. They get orders from Jones to track down and kill Robocop and Lewis.
	Boddicker’s team converges on the steel mill. RoboCop and Lewis defend themselves and kill the entire gang.
