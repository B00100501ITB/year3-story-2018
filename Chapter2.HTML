	<h1> Chapter 2 </h1>
	
	<p>
	RoboCop is guided by four directives written into his programming, but only three are explained to him:
	<p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	  <li>serve the public trust</li>
	  <li>protect the innocent</li>
	  <li>uphold the law </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Robocop is able to single-handedly deal with violent crime in the city causing the rest of the police 
	to talk of a strike in fear of being replaced. Meanwhile, RoboCop, though his mind was supposedly erased, still retains some memories of his life as Murphy, including glimpses of his wife and son,
	which confuse him. Lewis recognizes Robocop’s mannerisms, and tries to convince him that he is, in fact,
	Murphy — but Robocop does not understand.
